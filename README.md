# Face-Detection-and-Clustering
Leveraged OpenCV's face detection modules to detect faces in images, and crafted a bespoke K-Means clustering algorithm from the ground up to facilitate face clustering. Demonstrated a commendable accuracy score of 93%, gauged by the efficacy in grouping faces with identical identities within distinct clusters.
